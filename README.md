# CocktailRecipe
## Description 
The app is a cocktail recipe book. The user is provded with two categories of cocktails, alcaholic and non-alcoholic. When tapping on a cocktail icon, the user is taken to a description page where the image, name, ingredients, pictures of ingredients, glass type, and instructions are provided. The user can add the cocktail to favorites if the cocktail seams interesting. The bottom navigation bar can send the user to the favorites page where all of their favorite cocktails are displayed in a grid like format. The user can also search for a cocktail using the search page. The app requests all cocktail information from thecocktaildb.com. The api provides the cocktail image, description, instruction, as well as other information.

## Challenges
This was my first complete flutter project. I decided to use an Api to retrive data and made a pretty interesting and good looking project. Learning to effectively use api's to recieve and manipulate data was defiently the hardest part. Additionally, creating a class of favorites was challenging because the cocktails were not saved initially, they were simply retrieved from the api and not saved. 

## Outcome
All in all I defiently learned a lot in this project. I have never used a cross-platform framework before. The widget system used in flutter is defiently unique.
